            <h3>Coding Chronicles: From Seeds Planted to Fullstack Mastery</h3>
            <p>During my time at university, my interest in Information Technology
                 took root. Cast back to the year 2007 â€“ a time of flip phones, MySpace, and the dawn 
                 of a digital revolution. It was during this transformative era that I took my first 
                 steps on a path that would shape my future in ways I could never have imagined.<br/>
                 After leaving university in 2010, I embarked on a different career trajectory, 
                 venturing into the realm of retail and teaching. Despite the shift, my passion for 
                 Information Technology remained steadfast. The allure of technology's ever-evolving 
                 landscape continued to beckon me. It was clear that my heart belonged to the digital world.<br/>
                 In 2016, a decision that would mark a turning point in my journey was made. 
                 I chose to rekindle my connection with my true passion and reenter the realm of 
                 Information Technology. With unwavering determination, I set forth on a new path: 
                 the path of web development. Armed with the knowledge and experiences amassed over 
                 the years, I embraced this fresh chapter with enthusiasm, ready to embrace challenges 
                 and harness my skills to create digital wonders.

            <h5>ðŸŒ± 2016: Planting the Seeds - My Journey Begins ðŸŒ±</h5>
            <p>This is when my journey as a web developer commenced. Armed with an insatiable hunger to 
                learn and explore, I began nurturing the seeds of coding. Back then, I could only imagine
